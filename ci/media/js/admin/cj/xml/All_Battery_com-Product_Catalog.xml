<description>Untitled DocumentThe Most Powerful HID Flashlight on the Earth:This Tenergy 20W HID Rechargeable  Flashlight is the most powerful flashlight in its class. It illuminates  targets with true white light making objects easier to see due to  better contrast of colors and higher lumens. This powerful HID rechargeable flashlight is produced with the most efficient metal halide HID lamps, sometimes referred to as xenon lights. HID lamps produce light much like an electric arc welder by supplying  electricity between two electrodes, controlled by an electronic  ballast. Metal Halide lamps (HID) produce whiter light (higher kelvin  temperature) than regular flashlights which are high in the Red color  spectrum. The beam produced from HID is brighter, (producing more  lumens), on a per watt basis than incandescent or halogen flashlights.An  internal lithium ion battery, delivers stored power to illuminate for  1.5+ hours on full charge. Lithium ion batteries hold their charge  longer than alkaline or nickel metal hydride batteries, so HID is ready  for use even when stored for long periods of time. Designed for law  enforcement, border patrol, search &amp;amp; rescue, maritime interdiction,  and long-range target identification, this HID Flashlight is ideal for  recreational activities too, such as camping, hunting, hiking,  aviation, or as an emergency light anywhere. This 20W HID  rechargeable Flashlight is more powerful and rugged than ordinary  flashlights. They have no filament to break when dropped or jarred and  the HID metal halide bulb has a life span in excess of 2000+ hours.  Protective rubber lens &amp;amp; end caps help with shock absorption.  HID Flashlight is a self defense tool as well, if shined in an  adversaries eyes, its powerful and bright light will cause  disorientation. The end cap houses the charger receptacle for  convenient access for charging. This HID set comes with 90V AC-264V  DC charger that can be used anywhere in the world, and for maximum  versatility.The battery has a life span of 500+ charges and is  easily changed with backup battery should longer burn times be  required. HID light carries a one (1) year warranty on the lamp,  ballast, battery, on/off switch, &amp;amp; chargers, with a life time  warranty on the light body.Key Fetures  One mode20W, last 60 MinFlashlight ColorSilver  Lumin1400 Lumin  6000K white and Yellow Filter  Distance500 meter  Li battery2200mAh, more than 500 times life  Dimension(mm)300(L), Head79mm, Torch39mm  WaterproofIPX3 (not allow dip into water)  Silver Aluminum Box  One Kit Equipment1 flashlight, 100V-240V charger, Li-battery, Car charger, Strap, Yellow filter, Aluminum boxSpecial design on head so that it look like a fire-torchOther Features:Instant on less than 8 sec. to full brightness &amp;amp; Hot re-strikeEasy access charger plug located in end capOver charge protectionStrap and Case for easy carry and protectionCorrosion resistant extruded aluminumProtective rubber lens &amp;amp; end caps to absorb sh</description>

<description>See Other Similar Products!  The Olight T25  is one of the brightest AA powered flashlight made. For added  convenience it features five levels of output, high brightness strobe,  high and low brightness SOS mode, making 8 total output possibilities.  The Olight illumination level memory saves the last level used before  the light was turned off, returning to that level when the light is  turned back on.Easily operated, the various modes are accessed  by pressing the tail cap switch. Illumination level is adjusted by  twisting the head.Digital regulation using the constant current  technique  means that output at every brightness level will be constant not  fluctuating with battery life. Additionally the constant current  technique means greater efficiency for longer runtimes and the most  effiencient usage of the battery.The  T25 will flash to warn you when battery power is low, giving you the  opportunity to change batteries or adjust to a lower output level if  you need more illumination time.The Olight T25 utilizes a  unique linear pattern for brightness adjustment; which is different  from traditional PWM used by many competitors, to do away with the  strobing effect some users can perceive.

<keywords>rechargeable batteries,battery chargers,li-po charger, charger</keywords>
<description>100 Amp Watt Meter, 6S Lipo Checker, and 6S Balancer Detailed Description Specifications  Value  Input Power  max.60V  Max. current (Watt-meter)  100A  Min. operating voltage  7.2V  Power consumption (Battery checker)  approx. 20mA  Battery checker  2~6S  LiXX  Weight  120g  Dimension  110x60x23 mmNEW!! RCGroups Review of the e-Station TWO-MeterThe TWO-METER is a very sophisticated electronic device that is controlled by a high performance microprocessor and precision resistors. It has three functions; &amp;#147;watt-meter&amp;quot;, &amp;#147;battery checker&amp;quot; and self-balancer. Those functions are essential for electric flyers to ensure safe battery operationn and to measure the electric consumption of the power system. And the built-in balancer can equalize the individual voltages instantly.The TWO-METER can handle all types of Li-ion/Li-Polymer batteries(LiPo, LiIo, LiFe (A123)) consisting of up to 6 series-wired cells, but the battery pack must have a balancing plug for checking voltages.-  Watt-meter program  The Watt-meter circuit can measure the electric current up to 100A. You can verify the electric consumption on your power system.-  Battery checkerThe TWO-METER can show you the voltage and residual capacity of your Li-ion/Li-Polymer battery pack displaying each individual cells voltage. -  Integrated BalancerThe TWO-METER has an integrated balancing circuit which is self-operative without connecting to charger. When you connect the battery pack to the individual port of the TWO-METER the balancing sequence will begin instantly. In this case the individual cell voltages will be equalized to the lowest cell voltage of the battery pack. The TWO-METER can be used in conjunction with any Li-ion/Li-Polymer charger as well.-  Battery Connection to TWO-METERThe TWO-METER connects to the Li-ion/Li-Polymer battery via the balance connector on the battery. The connection is through the EAC12 series connection boards. Currently, the EAC12 series connection boards supports 2S through 6S for Align/Dualksy, Thunderpower/Flightpower, Polyquest/Hyperion, and Kokam. This covers more than 98% of lipo batteries on the market. For a complete listing of known lipo battery brands and their supported battery taps, click here.</description>

<description>.R1 {color#900;}Why Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery ?Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) NiMH Battery  is a combination of a rechargeable and a disposable battery, the next evolutionary step for batteries into the 21st century.  Because the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery has a very low self-discharge, battery loses its charge very slowly.  Low self-dischargeWhat makes the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery unique?  The key-advantage of the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery compared to usual rechargeable batteries is its extremely low self-discharge.Once charged, Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery keeps its charge even if you store it for 12 or 24 months. ( 85 percent of the charge after 12 months, 70 percent after 24 months ). For a rechargeable battery this is a revolutionary advantage. No more worries about the state of charge of your battery. Just, charge them and keep them. Even after months you will still have an almost full battery.  Long Battery Cycle LifeIn contrast to a disposable battery, the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery can be used over hundreds of times. This saves the environment and your purse. Thus one Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery saves the waste of 999 disposable batteries.  But also financially the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery has benefits.  Even if you consider the slightly higher cost of the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery compared to a disposable battery and add the cost for the charger and the energy consumed by the charger, the investment for one Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery returns easily after a few charging cycles.  Imagine how much money you have spent for batteries in your life. Now there is an end to this spending.  Broad Application  Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery - the only battery you will ever need, One battery for all applications.  Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery is the right battery for all your applications.  It replaces disposable batteries in Remote controls,CamerasClocks and alarm-clocksElectric torches,Radios,LCD-TVsToothbrushesShaversFlashlightsToys,MP3-PlayersElectronic gamesComputer-keyboards und mice. Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery-Excellent performance for your digicam  With Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery you can make substantially more shots with your digital camera than with any other disposable battery. The main advantages of NiMH rechargeable batteries exist also in the Tenergy Low Self-Discharge (LSD) Battery apr. 4 time more shots than with alkaline batteries high performance even at low temperatures down to  -10 C during your winter vacation  rechargeable and therefore cheaper on the long runCharging made easy  With normal rechargeable batteries it made sense to charge them just before you wanted to use them.

<description>Untitled DocumentSpecifications of 12 Series LiFePO4 Batteries  Charge &amp;amp; Discharge Guard ShieldApplication:The product  could be widely used in the fields of electric vehicles, standby power supply  and power supply of military equipment, etc.Main Functions:The product  has 5 main functionsover charge, over discharge, over current, short circuits and balancing.  Function of over  charge protectiononce voltage of any battery in the group gets higher than  the over charge protection point, charge cuts off to ensure all batteries work  within the over charge protection point.  Function of over  dischargeonce voltage of any battery in the group gets lower than the over  charge protection point, discharge cuts off to ensure all batteries work beyond  the over charge protection point.  Function of over  currentduring the discharge process of battery group, once discharge current  gets over the set over current protection point, output cuts off to ensure  battery group works within the safe limit of current.  Function of short  circuit protectiononce battery groups output port appears the condition of  short circuit, it cuts off to ensure battery group not to be damaged because of  short circuit.  Function of  voltage balancingin the late charging period of battery group, voltage  difference that appears during the using process of each battery could get  balancing revised to ensure battery groups capacitance.Specified TypesYS80302  Technical Index Item  12 seriesbalancing guard shieldOvercharge protection (V)3.95??0.025 Overcharge recovery (V)3.80??0.05 Overdischarge voltage (V)2.2??0.1 Overdischarge recovery (V)Cutload or chargeNormalworking current (A)30Overcurrent protection (A)60Internalresistance ??(??m/ohm)&amp;lt;30Chargingbalancing current (mA)60Chargingbalancing voltage (V)3.63??0.03 Overcharge postpone time (mS)1.2Overdischarge postpone time (mS)144Temperatureprotection (  )65 (option)Temperaturecharacteristic??1.0mv/Workingtemperature????????(  )-10~+60Storagetemperature??????????(  )-30~+85Powerloss (uA)&amp;lt;400 (Vn=3.2v normal)&amp;lt;200 (Vn2.2v??Under-voltage)  Dimensions (mm)120 x 60 x 9Weight(gram)78  Download Installation guide here.Usage and Attention After purchasing  the protection mould, users should connect lines in compliance with the  instruction. Voltage usually exists in the battery, so operators should peel  one line and then connect another starting from B-. Lines should be connected  from the low position to the high position with no mistake of order, or the  irreparable damage could be caused.  When lines get  connected, bits of copper and tin should not cling to the guard shield.  Protection board  should be connected to battery group with compliance to specifications and any  leading line should not be put on the back of the board but on the lateral  side.  When equipping  the guard shield, hard epoxy sheer should be fixed on the back of the board as  the barrier to prevent the squeezing against short circuit.  When welding </description>

<description>Untitled DocumentSpecifications of 16 Series LiFePO4 Batteries  Charge &amp;amp; Discharge Guard ShieldApplication:The product  could be widely used in the fields of electric vehicles, standby power supply  and power supply of military equipment, etc.Main Functions:The product  has 5 main functionsover charge, over discharge, over current, short circuits and balancing.  Function of over  charge protectiononce voltage of any battery in the group gets higher than  the over charge protection point, charge cuts off to ensure all batteries work  within the over charge protection point.  Function of over  dischargeonce voltage of any battery in the group gets lower than the over  charge protection point, discharge cuts off to ensure all batteries work beyond  the over charge protection point.  Function of over  currentduring the discharge process of battery group, once discharge current  gets over the set over current protection point, output cuts off to ensure  battery group works within the safe limit of current.  Function of short  circuit protectiononce battery groups output port appears the condition of  short circuit, it cuts off to ensure battery group not to be damaged because of  short circuit.  Function of  voltage balancingin the late charging period of battery group, voltage  difference that appears during the using process of each battery could get  balancing revised to ensure battery groups capacitance.Specified TypesYS80303  Technical Index Item  16 seriesbalancing guard shieldOvercharge protection (V)3.95??0.025 Overcharge recovery (V)3.80??0.05 Overdischarge voltage (V)2.2??0.1 Overdischarge recovery (V)Cutload or chargeNormalworking current (A)15Overcurrent protection (A)30Internalresistance ??(??m/ohm)&amp;lt;30Chargingbalancing current (mA)60Chargingbalancing voltage (V)3.63??0.03 Overcharge postpone time (mS)1.2Overdischarge postpone time (mS)144Temperatureprotection (  )65 (Option)Temperaturecharacteristic??1.0mv/Workingtemperature????????(  )-10~+60Storagetemperature??????????(  )-30~+85Powerloss (uA)&amp;lt;400 (Vn=3.2v normal)&amp;lt;200 (Vn2.2v Under-voltage)  Dimensions (mm)145 x 60 x 9Weight(gram)90  Download Installation guide here.Usage and Attention After purchasing  the protection mould, users should connect lines in compliance with the  instruction. Voltage usually exists in the battery, so operators should peel  one line and then connect another starting from B-. Lines should be connected  from the low position to the high position with no mistake of order, or the  irreparable damage could be caused.  When lines get  connected, bits of copper and tin should not cling to the guard shield.  Protection board  should be connected to battery group with compliance to specifications and any  leading line should not be put on the back of the board but on the lateral  side.  When equipping  the guard shield, hard epoxy sheer should be fixed on the back of the board as  the barrier to prevent the squeezing against short circuit.  When welding  </description>

<description>Untitled DocumentSpecifications of 16 Series LiFePO4 Batteries  Charge &amp;amp; Discharge Guard ShieldApplication:The product  could be widely used in the fields of electric vehicles, standby power supply  and power supply of military equipment, etc.Main Functions:The product  has 5 main functionsover charge, over discharge, over current, short circuits and balancing.  Function of over  charge protectiononce voltage of any battery in the group gets higher than  the over charge protection point, charge cuts off to ensure all batteries work  within the over charge protection point.  Function of over  dischargeonce voltage of any battery in the group gets lower than the over  charge protection point, discharge cuts off to ensure all batteries work beyond  the over charge protection point.  Function of over  currentduring the discharge process of battery group, once discharge current  gets over the set over current protection point, output cuts off to ensure  battery group works within the safe limit of current.  Function of short  circuit protectiononce battery groups output port appears the condition of  short circuit, it cuts off to ensure battery group not to be damaged because of  short circuit.  Function of  voltage balancingin the late charging period of battery group, voltage  difference that appears during the using process of each battery could get  balancing revised to ensure battery groups capacitance.Specified TypesYS80303  Technical Index Item  16 seriesbalancing guard shieldOvercharge protection (V)3.95??0.025 Overcharge recovery (V)3.80??0.05 Overdischarge voltage (V)2.2??0.1 Overdischarge recovery (V)Cutload or chargeNormalworking current (A)30Overcurrent protection (A)60Internalresistance ??(??m/ohm)&amp;lt;30Chargingbalancing current (mA)60Chargingbalancing voltage (V)3.63??0.03 Overcharge postpone time (mS)1.2Overdischarge postpone time (mS)144Temperatureprotection (  )65 (option) Temperaturecharacteristic??1.0mv/Workingtemperature????????(  )-10~+60Storagetemperature??????????(  )-30~+85Powerloss (uA)&amp;lt;400 (Vn=3.2v normal)&amp;lt;200 (Vn2.2v Under-voltage)  Dimensions (mm)145 x 60 x 9Weight(gram)98  Download Installation guide here.Usage and Attention After purchasing  the protection mould, users should connect lines in compliance with the  instruction. Voltage usually exists in the battery, so operators should peel  one line and then connect another starting from B-. Lines should be connected  from the low position to the high position with no mistake of order, or the  irreparable damage could be caused.  When lines get  connected, bits of copper and tin should not cling to the guard shield.  Protection board  should be connected to battery group with compliance to specifications and any  leading line should not be put on the back of the board but on the lateral  side.  When equipping  the guard shield, hard epoxy sheer should be fixed on the back of the board as  the barrier to prevent the squeezing against short circuit.  When welding </description>

<description>See Other Similar Products!  The Special Edition Olight TACTICAL T20 (T20-T) features  five levels of output. The Tactical version also features a redesigned  switch with a momentary feature at half-press and a redesigned body  optimized for the cigar / syringe / Rogers hold alongside a handgun.  The Tactical also offers a lockout feature to prevent accidental  activation.Easily operated, the various Illumination levels are  adjusted by twisting the head. The Olight illumination level memory  saves the last level used before the light was turned off, returning to  that level when the light is turned back on.Digital regulation  using the constant current technique  means that output at every brightness level will be constant not  fluctuating with battery life. Additionally the constant current  technique means greater efficiency for longer runtimes and the most  effiencient usage of the battery.The  T20 will flash to warn you when battery power is low, giving you the  opportunity to change batteries or adjust to a lower output level if  you need more illumination time.The Olight T20 TACTICAL  utilizes a unique linear pattern for brightness adjustment; which is  different from traditional PWM used by many competitors, to do away  with the strobing effect some users can perceive.Specifications:Uses 2 X CR123A batteries - primary or rechargeable.

<description>Olight Diffuser/Filter for FT20 series Different size used for T series and M20 series.Red Filter produces a smooth beam of red light that will not degrade night vision as white light would. Hunters use the red filter to avoid spooking game during predawn hours - deer see poorly in the red color spectrum. The filter is also useful for close range, non-tactical applications - such as map reading -- as it reduces the intensity of light output.

<name>2-6 Cell Lipo Pack Balancer</name>
<keywords>rechargeable batteries,battery chargers,battery charger, charger, li-ion battery charger, li-ion charger</keywords>
<description>Untitled Document  Ultra-Balancer is the simplest method of keeping your Lipo packs balanced.It can be used for packs up to 22.2 volts (6S). Works as a stand-alone balancer before charging or simultaneously with your charger doing it&#39;s balancing function at the same time that your pack is being charged.2.5mm spacing on pin connection allows over 90% of the packs in the market to be used without any adapter required.offer an adapter in the &#34;Accessories&#34; category to facilitate the balancing of Thunder Power packs.Connector has 0.100 in pin spacing with 0.025 square pins and fits Apogee and other brands. Pins should be in orderred, black, black and black with no gaps or missing pins in the sequence.Using Your New Balancer Low Voltage Check First connect the Balancer to the Lithium pack. Connect the most negative connection on the battery to the most negative pin on the balancer. If all cells are 3.2 volts or more all LED&amp;rsquo;s will turn on and remain lit for 5 seconds. If you have a three cell pack the first three LED will turn on. If one cell is low and has less than 3.2 volts that LED will not turn on. This means that your battery pack has been discharged too far. DO NOT CHARGE FAST!! Set your charge rate between 0.1 amps and 0.2 amps and wait until the LED&amp;rsquo;s begin to blink again. This indicates that at least one cell has reached 3.7 volts or more. Disconnect balancer and then reconnect for another Low Voltage Test. Repeat as needed until all LED&amp;rsquo;s turn on for 5 seconds indicating that all cells have at least 3.2 volts. Then you can proceed to charge normally.  Balancing While Charging Connect the balancer and wait for the low voltage check.If all cells show 3.2 volts you can proceed with a normal charge sequence. The LED lamps will remain off until one cell reaches a voltage of 3.7 volts. Then balancing will begin. By the time the charge is complete the pack should be balanced. If the cells blink at random the pack is closely balanced. If a few LED&amp;rsquo;s remain on all the time these cells have a higher voltage then the other cells and more balancing is needed. When the charge is almost complete all the LED&amp;rsquo;s will turn on.  Balancing After Charging Connect the Balancer to the pack. The balancer will begin discharging every cell that has more than 4.15 volts. When all cells are 4.15 volts or less then the balancer will begin balancing to the lowest cell. When all Led&amp;rsquo;s turn off or occasionally blink at random, then the pack is balanced</description>

Make sure user has enough knowledge on Li-Ion rechargeable batteries in charging, discharging and assembly before use. Put the batteries in fire-proofenvironment in chargingNever leave batteries unattended when chargingDo not put batteries on wood surface or carpet when chargingWe are not responsible for any damage caused by misusing or mishandling of Li-Ion / Li-Polymer batteries in charging We are not responsible for damage caused by other Li-ion batteries not supplied from us Do not make any changes to the charger, charger accessories or connectors, as this might cause electrical shortage, fire or over-heating during charging. We are not liable for the product if any changes are made to the charger, accessories or connectors.  Ultra-Balancer is the simplest method of keeping your Lipo packs balanced.It can be used for packs up to 14.8 volts (4S). Works as a stand-alone balancer before charging or simultaneously with your charger doing it&#39;s balancing function at the same time that your pack is being charged.2.5mm spacing on pin connection allows over 90% of the packs in the market to be used without any adapter required.offer an adapter in the &#34;Accessories&#34; category to facilitate the balancing of Thunder Power packs.Connector has 0.100 in pin spacing with 0.025 square pins and fits Apogee and other brands. Pins should be in orderred, black, black and black with no gaps or missing pins in the sequence.Using Your New Balancer Low Voltage Check First connect the Balancer to the Li-ion/Li-Polymer pack. Connect the most negative connection on the battery to the most negative pin on the balancer. If all cells are 3.2 volts or more all LEDs will turn on and remain lit for 5 seconds. If you have a three cell pack the first three LED will turn on. If one cell is low and has less than 3.2 volts that LED will not turn on. This means that your battery pack has been discharged too far. DO NOT CHARGE FAST!! Set your charge rate between 0.1 amps and 0.2 amps a</description>

<description>Features A low voltage cutoff device which enables any ESC to be used with lithiumbattery packs. It installs easily between your receiver and ESC and provides a reliable 3.0Vper cell soft cutoff to prevent over-discharge damage to your expensive lipopacks.A soft cutoff, so it is appropriate for any plane, even 3D types. The softcutoff gradually reduces power to the motor allowing you to make a controlledlanding.When you notice the aircraft becoming sluggish, it is time to bring it in.The cutoff can be reset by throttling down to zero, then throttling back up.This enables a go around to prevent emergency landings and long walks toretrieve your plane.Automatically detects the number of lithium cells in your battery pack atpower-up and sets the appropriate cutoff voltage. It then continuously displaysthe detected number of cells by blinking the Cells LED. LipoShield workswhether youre running a BEC built into your ESC, a separate BEC such as ParkBECor even a receiver pack.Uses a microcontroller to modify the throttle signal sent from the receiver to the speed control. As a result, it works equally well with older ESCs that have no lithium cutoff settings, and new ESCs that have unreliable cutoffs. It will even work in conjunction with another soft cutoff built into your speed control.Lipo Shield works equally well with brushed or brushless ESCs.SpecificationsModelLipoShield  SpecificationsInput voltage1s to 12s Lithium or LithiumPolymer  Cutoff voltage3.0V/cell  Weight3.5g/.13oz  Works with allESCs  ApplicationsAny plane without an effective lithium cutoff.</description>

<description>Untitled DocumentProduct Description  The DE-SWADJ is the adjustable version of our SW0XX step down  voltage regulators.It is designed to be the easiest possible way to  add an adjustable voltage source to a new or existing project with all  the efficiency benefits of switch-mode power.The DE-SWADJ is  pin-compatible with the common 78XX family of linear voltage  regulators, and has a small screw on top that allows you change the  output voltage as your project evolves.It has integrated decoupling  capacitors, so external capacitors are not generally necessary.DE-SWADJ can deliver a maximum of 10 Watts.  The screw potentiometer on DE-SWADJ is worm-gear driven, so small  vibrations and movement will not cause the voltage to shift. Use of  glue to hold the screw in place is strongly discouraged and could  damage the device. Product Specs  Performance  Adjustable from 1.25 to 13V output using screw1A output at 1.25 to 10V  (Please see datasheet for current ratings at higher voltages)  &amp;gt;90% efficiency at &amp;gt;9v out1.3V typical dropout voltage at full loadCan be put in  parallelWeight5.5g  Applications  Battery powered applications  Robots  Battery chargingElectronics prototyping  Powering multiple servos at their max rated voltageDatasheet  DE-SWADJ.doc (386kb)  DE-SWADJ.pdf (126kb)</description>
