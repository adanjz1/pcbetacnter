  -- Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
  -- "feature" to Internet Explorer.  If the text in
  -- an error's message is "too small", specifically
  -- less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
  -- its own error message.  Yes, you can turn that
  -- off, but *surprise* it's pretty tricky to find
  -- buried as a switch called "smart error
  -- messages"  That means, of course, that many of
  -- Resin's error messages are censored by default.
  -- And, of course, you'll be shocked to learn that
  -- IIS always returns error messages that are long
  -- enough to make Internet Explorer happy.  The
  -- workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
  -- message with a big comment to push it over the
  -- five hundred and twelve byte minimum.  Of course,
  -- that's exactly what you're reading right now.
