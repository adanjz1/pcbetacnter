SPAW Editor PHP Edition
Version 2.0.8.1

2.0.8.1 Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

This is a hotfix release for a possible security issue in file 
class/theme.class.php

Users of previous 2.x versions can just overwrite the above mentioned file. 
It hasn't changed since version 2.0.

For a complete list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes some language files that were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
